When I returned from travelling, I found that it was very difficult to buy the seasonings and 
blends I had used while I was abroad. Having the finest flavours from authentic spices really
 does make a difference to cooking, whether you want to create a certain dish or if youâ€™re just
  experimenting. I wanted to share what I had learned, and hoped that by making these 
exciting authentic seasonings widely available that I would also offer inspiration to others.
